## Project Description

### Subject area
The project is an online version of a modern bookstore, where the user can easily access the full list of books, view detailed information about the book, the author. Thanks to the implemented system of filtering books by genre and searching by title, author or content, it will not be difficult to find the right content. With the help of feedback, the user will always be able to quickly receive answers from the administration to questions of interest, and the system of book reviews and rating based on opinion users will make the choice even easier. The application implements an API for easy integration with various services and the possibility of scaling in the future.

### The application has created:
- a model of books with the following attributes: title, description, number of pages, price, cover type, dimensions, publication date, cover photo.

### Installation

* Clone the repository using the command in the terminal `git clone https://github.com/alexeyvershinin/django_bookstore.git` or download the archive from the [link](https://github.com/alexeyvershinin/django_bookstore/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
* Install dependencies from the file requirements.txt using the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command
* In the file `settings.py` write down the connection parameters to your database, when developing the project I used Postgresql 14, but you can use any database convenient to you, according to the Django documentation
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'db_name',
        'USER': 'db_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'db_user_password',
        'HOST': 'db_host',
        'PORT': 'db_port_number',
    }
}
```
* Important! If you see an error `cannot import name 'ungettext_lazy' from 'django.utils.translation'`, you need to edit the file `..\Lib\site-packages\url_filter\validators.py` which is located in your virtual environment or in a folder with a local Python(if you don't use venv) by replacing all the `ungettext_lazy` lines with `gettext_lazy`
* Perform migrations using the `python manage.py migrate` command
* Ð¡reate a superuser with the command `python manage.py createsuperuser`
* Start the server with the command `python manage.py runserver`
